# GWC_BeginnerLevel_Activities

this repo contains the main coding activities we did in our girls who code beginner level class.  
each folder lines up with a class day and topic.

## structure

- `day1_intro/` – hello world and first print statements
- `day2_variables/` – input, variables, and data types
- `day3_conditionals/` – if / elif / else and logic
- `day4_collections/` – lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- `day5_loops_files/` – loops, ascii art, and file writing

students can:
- re-run any file in github codespaces
- use these as starting points for their own projects
- copy pieces of code into new programs
