# GWC_BeginnerLevel_Activities

This repo contains the main coding activities we did in our UIC Girls Who Code beginner level class (2025-2026.  
Each folder lines up with a class day and topic.

## Folder Content Structure

- `Day1/` – hello world and first print statements
- `Day2/` – input, variables, and data types
- `Day3/` – if / elif / else and logic
- `Day4/` – lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries

Students can:
